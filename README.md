# live-football-streams
Flask app that scrapes Reddit for a list of live football streams for your favorite team. 
I have a live version running on http://abdhan.pythonanywhere.com Just enter the name of any one team and get streams. Recommended to check 5 minutes or later from kick-off.

REQUIRES:
PRAW to scrape links
RE
FLASK for webapp

To Run: Run app.py like any other Flask webapp.

TODO:
Include more sports maybe.
